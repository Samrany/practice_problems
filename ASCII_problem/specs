WHAT MAKES THIS AN API????

API draw rectangles and squares
- print canvas and any shapes to standard output. 10 x 10 output.
- add a shape (rectangles)
- clear all shapes
- create a rectangle using params specified
- change a rectangle's fill character
- translate (move up, down, left, right)


function that calls shape must call 



array/canvas 10 x 10 with coordinates.

add function: adds a rectangle??

create function: changes empty coordinates to specific character. requires starting coordinates and size.

change fill: (how does it know which rectangle? has to take a variable name to point to specific ?)

translate: same as above.

clear: loops over each square and clears it

print: prints the canvas to the terminal
